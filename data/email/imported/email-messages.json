If they are enabled, so let me lay this out carefully. I have triggers on insert and update of pizza_topping, pizza_discount, and order_discount (and yes, the triggers use stored functions) that update pizza and order prices+costs (incl discounts) If the triggers are enabled while the autograder is populating any of those 3 tables (), there's a pretty good chance that the price and cost of the pizza and/or order is going to be set wrong In the autograder environment, I don't have control over when the triggers are enabled In my local environment, I address this by not enabling the triggers (and functions and SPs) until after the non-transactional tables (customer, discount, baseprice, topping) are populated. Then I run a local script (not submitted to not confuse the autograder) that use the stored automation and triggers to populate ordertable, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping. This works great in my local environment I thought this was in-line with our previous email, but we're concerned that the triggers get executed at the wrong time and cause the grader to fail tests Questions: Have I made the concern clear? Is it okay to have triggers changing order and pizza price & cost? IMPORTANT: My partner (Gary) is super-jammed tonight, but he has been handling the submissions for our team. Can I take over doing submissions for our team tonight? Thanks & sorry, I thought this was in-the-can several hours ago.

For now, yes. They shouldn’t need to modify the topping inventory. They are already deducted and given to you. You need to apply order discounts. Pizza discount is applied and given to you! 2. They will be executed and manually verified as well! 3. You can use them! Best, Koushik.

More generally, will the autograder execute our triggers, SPs, and functions? Or is that more of a manual grading step? Just trying to think about autograder compliations… Should we be implementing CASCADEs on e.g., deletion of a pizza or an order? Or is this a bad idea? Thanks, Marc",

This window ends at 11:59pm ET, so if you feel you may need to withdraw from a class, you need to do so before that date/time in order to not receive a final grade. The course will still appear on your transcript; however, your grade would show a “W” and does not impact your GPA. After this date/time, you will receive a final grade for the course. Second, registration for the Spring 2025 semester begins on Wednesday, November 6th at 8am ET. We will be offering both of the PBA courses (CPSC 8400 and 8740) in the Spring, and we will also be adding CPSC 6300, CPSC 6620, and HCC 6600 to the courses available through Coursera. If you have any questions about withdrawing or registration, please let me know by sending an email to mscscoursera@clemson.edu.

Gantt Stole Registration Registration deadline Tuesday, April 1st at 11:59 PM at this link We are excited to offer all 2025 graduates the opportunity to get a Gantt graduation stole. The stole is a symbol of prestige and an official rite of passage. The Kente cloth was developed in the 17th century by the Ashanti people of Ghana as a form of royal regalia considered to be a symbol of accomplishment and prestige. The Kente is often reserved for special occasions and the colors and markings signify special meanings. The Gantt stoles are black, denoting a rite of passage, with purple and orange stripes that represent Clemson University. The Siamese Crocodile is a symbol of democracy and unity. The Gantt name embroidered on the stole carries a two-fold meaning: first, to honor the legacy of Harvey and Lucinda Gantt, and second, to express the Gantt Center’s gratitude for the graduates’ contributions to the Clemson community during their time as students, and now as alumni. To receive the Gantt Stole, students must be a May, August, or December graduate and are REQUIRED to register. Stoles are very limited and will be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration does NOT guarantee a stole. You will be notified on Thursday, April 3rd, of the status of your registration. If you would like to request a stole, please REGISTER HERE. 3.

I.e., it should clearly populate the non-transactional tables (baseprice, customer, topping, discount), but should it also populate the transactional tables (ordertable, pickup, delivery, dinein, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping)? I'm asking because, at this point, our automation + a 'add all the orders' script generates a complete post order entry database & I can just use `mysqldump --no-create-info --skip-triggers --skip-routines` to get a script that will regenerate that complete database. I just don't want to submit that if what you really want is to just populate the non-transactional tables.

I think that there may be a problem with the cost of the first pizza in order #4 (highlighted below): #4. On April 20th at 7:11 pm there was a delivery order made by Andrew Wilkes-Krier for 1 xlarge pepperoni and Sausage pizza (Price: $27.94, Cost: $9.19), one xlarge pizza with Ham (extra) and Pineapple (extra) pizza (Price: $31.50, Cost: $6.25), and one xlarge Chicken and Bacon pizza (Price: $26.75, Cost: $5.55). All the pizzas have the Four Cheese Blend on it and are original crust. The order has the “Gameday Special” discount applied to it, and the ham and pineapple pizza has the “Specialty Pizza” discount applied to it. The pizzas were delivered to 115 Party Blvd, Anderson SC 29621. His phone number is the same as before. I have run this calculation manually and via our automation many (so many) times and the answer I keep getting is $5.5875 -> $5.59. As a sanity cross-check, it does not seem reasonable that the first pizza in that order should be quite a bit more expensive than the other two pizzas of the same size (even accounting for the “Specialty Pizza” discount). Don't worry, at this point I'm not waiting on your response 😉 (unless of course I've missed something really dumb here). Just pointing it out.",

Do schools?Are they required entities? I think the location field covers it. Do we need this?All you need is a class and class cost. Do assistant leaders have a cost? What if they're volunteers? Only the primary leader has the cost. Do sessions have a price? I.e., that non-leading students pay? If so, do assistant leaders have to pay? Not needed Do we need to document cardinality? (vs. connectivity) No, cardinality is not required to be documented, but implied from the ERD relationships. Are we okay expanding the student attributes? I.e., adding basic contact information? Sure. Extra attributes are fine. Do we need to describe levels in addition to naming them? I would describe them. The business rules mention \"schools\" and \"rooms\"—are schools important to location? Or should we just have \"LOCATION\" that has school and room identifiers? You can just specify the location as part of the class information but not needed as a separate entity. Do we need to track student class attendance history? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Do we need to track history of sessions/leaders? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Should we subclass 'LEADER' & use specialization hierarchy? Yes Is the assignment of leaders at a class level or session level? This is a design decision - document what you decide in the rational you are providing. Do we need to use the dependency diagram notations, EERM? The dependency diagram is unnecessary; however, you should think about your ERD and ensure it is in 3NF. Do we connect relationships at an entity or attribute level for the Relationships are always between entities ? Not sure I understand your question. connectors14) What does an A grade look like? What do we need to do to make it happen. ERD that meets the requirements and we can use rationale to validate your decisions. There are different ways to implement this. Do we need to track students' date of joining? Enroll date? Yes Please let us know if any of the questions need to be clarified. Thanks, Marc",

I don't know if it's intentional or not but I'm pretty sure the key designations for 'Treatment_Apt' are incorrect—I think TREATMENT_ID & APPOINTMENT_ID are both attributes of a composite PK and also that they are both independently FKs In Treatment, TREATMENT_ID is both misspelled ('TREAMENT_ID', i.e., missing the second 'T'), and mislabeled as an FK The third answer option is missing a comma between 'Pet' and 'Appointments' Thank you",

I.e., it should clearly populate the non-transactional tables (baseprice, customer, topping, discount), but should it also populate the transactional tables (ordertable, pickup, delivery, dinein, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping)? I'm asking because, at this point, our automation + a 'add all the orders' script generates a complete post order entry database & I can just use `mysqldump --no-create-info --skip-triggers --skip-routines` to get a script that will regenerate that complete database. I just don't want to submit that if what you really want is to just populate the non-transactional tables.

I think that there may be a problem with the cost of the first pizza in order #4 (highlighted below): #4. On April 20th at 7:11 pm there was a delivery order made by Andrew Wilkes-Krier for 1 xlarge pepperoni and Sausage pizza (Price: $27.94, Cost: $9.19), one xlarge pizza with Ham (extra) and Pineapple (extra) pizza (Price: $31.50, Cost: $6.25), and one xlarge Chicken and Bacon pizza (Price: $26.75, Cost: $5.55). All the pizzas have the Four Cheese Blend on it and are original crust. The order has the “Gameday Special” discount applied to it, and the ham and pineapple pizza has the “Specialty Pizza” discount applied to it. The pizzas were delivered to 115 Party Blvd, Anderson SC 29621. His phone number is the same as before. I have run this calculation manually and via our automation many (so many) times and the answer I keep getting is $5.5875 -> $5.59. As a sanity cross-check, it does not seem reasonable that the first pizza in that order should be quite a bit more expensive than the other two pizzas of the same size (even accounting for the “Specialty Pizza” discount). Don't worry, at this point I'm not waiting on your response 😉 (unless of course I've missed something really dumb here). Just pointing it out.",

Do schools?Are they required entities? I think the location field covers it. Do we need this?All you need is a class and class cost. Do assistant leaders have a cost? What if they're volunteers? Only the primary leader has the cost. Do sessions have a price? I.e., that non-leading students pay? If so, do assistant leaders have to pay? Not needed Do we need to document cardinality? (vs. connectivity) No, cardinality is not required to be documented, but implied from the ERD relationships. Are we okay expanding the student attributes? I.e., adding basic contact information? Sure. Extra attributes are fine. Do we need to describe levels in addition to naming them? I would describe them. The business rules mention \"schools\" and \"rooms\"—are schools important to location? Or should we just have \"LOCATION\" that has school and room identifiers? You can just specify the location as part of the class information but not needed as a separate entity. Do we need to track student class attendance history? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Do we need to track history of sessions/leaders? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Should we subclass 'LEADER' & use specialization hierarchy? Yes Is the assignment of leaders at a class level or session level? This is a design decision - document what you decide in the rational you are providing. Do we need to use the dependency diagram notations, EERM? The dependency diagram is unnecessary; however, you should think about your ERD and ensure it is in 3NF. Do we connect relationships at an entity or attribute level for the Relationships are always between entities ? Not sure I understand your question. connectors14) What does an A grade look like? What do we need to do to make it happen. ERD that meets the requirements and we can use rationale to validate your decisions. There are different ways to implement this. Do we need to track students' date of joining? Enroll date? Yes Please let us know if any of the questions need to be clarified. Thanks, Marc",

Then I run a local script (not submitted to not confuse the autograder) that use the stored automation and triggers to populate ordertable, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping. This works great in my local environment I thought this was in-line with our previous email, but we're concerned that the triggers get executed at the wrong time and cause the grader to fail tests Questions: Have I made the concern clear?

I now have a question on the Module 7 Lab Problem Sets—I have only worked through ProblemSet01 so far and I used ROUND() in several of the solutions to match the format of the expected result. E.g., For Problem 6, the expected result is as follows: … -- The results of running that query are shown below: -- -- +---------+------------+-------------------+--------------------+ -- | EMP_NUM | EMP_LNAME | SumOfASSIGN_HOURS | SumOfASSIGN_CHARGE | -- +---------+------------+-------------------+--------------------+ -- | 101 | News | 3.1 | 387.50 | -- | 103 | Arbough | 19.7 | 1664.65 | -- | 104 | Ramoras | 11.9 | 1218.70 | -- | 105 | Johnson | 12.5 | 1382.50 | -- | 108 | Washington | 8.3 | 840.15 | -- | 113 | Joenbrood | 3.8 | 192.85 | -- | 115 | Bawangi | 12.5 | 1276.75 | -- | 117 | Williamson | 18.8 | 649.54 | -- +---------+------------+-------------------+--------------------+ The key point being that the results in the 'SumOfASSIGN_CHARGE' column have 2 digits to the right of the decimal. So, my solution was to use ROUND() as follows: /* YOUR SOLUTION HERE */ SELECT ASSIGNMENT.EMP_NUM, EMP_LNAME, ROUND(SUM(ASSIGN_HOURS), 1) AS 'SumOfASSIGN_HOURS', ROUND(SUM(ASSIGN_CHARGE), 2) AS 'SumOfASSIGN_CHARGE' FROM ASSIGNMENT JOIN EMPLOYEE ON ASSIGNMENT.EMP_NUM = EMPLOYEE.EMP_NUM GROUP BY EMPLOYEE.EMP_NUM ORDER BY EMP_NUM; And I wanted to make sure this wasn't going to confuse the autograder before I submit it.

As you can see in the screenshot of the diff output, the problems that I have already submitted solutions for are the same as the problems in \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\" (the SQL is different because I have already corrected and tested the SQL included with \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\").

The 1st option is correct, even though it is not a good practice to modify the CamelCase to UpperCase, the query still works. 2. Regarding this, you need to submit the graded app item and you need to modify the script and make it executable. Like there are some syntax errors given in the script, you need to update them and make sure it runs in your local. Than you can submit it.

Option 3 is flat wrong, and while I have been toldthat some RDMSs will accept the final clause in Option 2 (`AND SPECIES IS 'Cat';`), I'm pretty sure that won't work in MySQL. What am I missing?

    "content": "Hi Marc, Thanks for letting us know! The hold for transcripts should be removed from your account. I was notified by Grad Admissions that for students who are completing both PBAs this semester, you will receive a different hold that is waiting for your final grades to publish. Grad Admissions should be sending a notice out, but the reason for this is because if you register now, your courses will get dropped if you pass the PBA courses and receive full admission to the MS. This is unfortunately just a function of our system, but the good news is that you are one step closer to full admission! If you have any follow up questions about this, don't hesitate to reach out! Kind regards, Becca Spilka --------------- Original Message --------------- From: Marc Leavitt [leavitt@clemson.edu] Sent: 11/7/2024, 8:49 AM To: mscscoursera@clemson.edu Subject: Re: Final Official Transcripts + Registration Update Hi! Marc Leavitt (Student ID: C18197647) here. Thanks for the reminder! FYI - I have just received confirmation from Parchment that my transcript \"was successfully received by Clemson University - Graduate Programs on 11/06/2024\" Thank you, Marc ________________________________ From: MSCS Coursera <mscscoursera@clemson.edu> Sent: Friday, November 1, 2024 6:59 AM Subject: Final Official Transcripts + Registration Update Hi all, I have an update regarding the submission of Final Official Transcripts that may impact your registration next week. For Final Official Transcripts, you must submit these to Clemson’s Graduate School within your first semester of enrollment. If you do not, then there is a hold placed on your account that will prevent you from registering. You can check your account for this transcript hold (as well as other holds) by logging into iRoar > Student Self-Service > under Student Records header > Advising Student Profile. From here, you will see a notification for holds in the top, right corner. Any holds that will prevent registration should provide specific instructions on how to remove the hold, but if you have any questions or concerns about the holds, please let me know! If your undergraduate university is in the US and offers virtual transcripts, then it should only take a few days to receive the transcript and update your profile. However, if you must mail in your transcript, then this process may take a bit longer. The very good news is that there is no cap on our Coursera classes, so you are still guaranteed a seat, as long as we receive your transcript before the last day to add a class! If you haven’t already, I would recommend that you submit your transcript as soon as possible to avoid any delays. I do want to apologize as normally notifications go out to students throughout the semester with reminders about their final transcripts, but unfortunately, due to a technical error, these notifications were not going out. Additionally, I believe some of the language in the orientation module may have been misleading, and we are having that updated! Again, I sincerely apologize for any confusion or inconvenience. However, we can hopefully get everyone sorted before the start of the Spring semester! I’ve attached our Final Official Transcript procedures for your reference. Thank you all so much for your patience! With this being a new program, we might run into a few technical issues along the way, but we are so excited to have you all on board! We hope that you are enjoying the curriculum and are excited to continue in the program!

They collect and process vast amounts of data through various onboard subsystems. One significant player in this landscape is Android Automotive OS (AAOS), which has been integrated into over 100 million vehicles and has become a dominant force in the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) market. With this extensive data collection, privacy concerns have become increasingly crucial. The volume of data gathered by these systems raises questions about how this information is stored, used, and protected, making privacy a critical issue for manufacturers and consumers. However, very little has been done on vehicle data privacy. This paper focuses on the privacy implications of AAOS by examining the exact nature and scope of its data collection. It also presents a novel automotive privacy analysis tool called PriDrive, which employs three methodological approaches: network traffic inspection, and both static and dynamic analyses of Android images using rooted emulators from various OEMs. Finally, the evaluation on three different OEM platforms reveals that some OEMs collect much more data than others. OEM A collects vehicle speed at a sampling rate of roughly 25 Hz. Meanwhile, other properties such as model info, climate and AC, seat data, and others are collected in a batch 30 seconds into vehicle startup..

All the pizzas have the Four Cheese Blend on it and are original crust. The order has the “Gameday Special” discount applied to it, and the ham and pineapple pizza has the “Specialty Pizza” discount applied to it. The pizzas were delivered to 115 Party Blvd, Anderson SC 29621. His phone number is the same as before. I have run this calculation manually and via our automation many (so many) times and the answer I keep getting is $5.5875 -> $5.59. As a sanity cross-check, it does not seem reasonable that the first pizza in that order should be quite a bit more expensive than the other two pizzas of the same size (even accounting for the “Specialty Pizza” discount).

Do schools?Are they required entities? I think the location field covers it. Do we need this?All you need is a class and class cost. Do assistant leaders have a cost? What if they're volunteers? Only the primary leader has the cost. Do sessions have a price? I.e., that non-leading students pay? If so, do assistant leaders have to pay? Not needed Do we need to document cardinality? (vs. connectivity) No, cardinality is not required to be documented, but implied from the ERD relationships. Are we okay expanding the student attributes? I.e., adding basic contact information? Sure. Extra attributes are fine. Do we need to describe levels in addition to naming them? I would describe them. The business rules mention \"schools\" and \"rooms\"—are schools important to location? Or should we just have \"LOCATION\" that has school and room identifiers? You can just specify the location as part of the class information but not needed as a separate entity. Do we need to track student class attendance history? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Do we need to track history of sessions/leaders? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Should we subclass 'LEADER' & use specialization hierarchy? Yes Is the assignment of leaders at a class level or session level? This is a design decision - document what you decide in the rational you are providing. Do we need to use the dependency diagram notations, EERM? The dependency diagram is unnecessary; however, you should think about your ERD and ensure it is in 3NF. Do we connect relationships at an entity or attribute level for the Relationships are always between entities ? Not sure I understand your question. connectors14) What does an A grade look like? What do we need to do to make it happen. ERD that meets the requirements and we can use rationale to validate your decisions. There are different ways to implement this. Do we need to track students' date of joining? Enroll date? Yes Please let us know if any of the questions need to be clarified. Thanks, Marc",

Professor Taylor, correct me if I am wrong, I don't see any 3NF violation because. as the field is not having any transitive dependency with any other attribute in the table. Regarding expanding the hierarchy, If you want to you can increase it. But that is not mandatory to do so. From the image, make sure you use the correct distinguisher(disjoint/overlapping).

The guideline suggests we include a discriminator in the supertype, but we currently have a partial disjoint subtype (0..1) with supertype Student and subtype Leader. Adding a discriminator field \"is_a_leader\" to Student would break 3NF because that field would depend on the existence of a related record in the Leader table rather than solely on the student_id. In our design, if we want to designate a student as a leader, we insert a record into the Leader table and rely on the existence of that record (via the shared PK, FK). This avoids an extra CRUD operation and redundant data. If a student becomes a leader, I would have to do 2 operations: an update to Student.student_is_a_leader and an insert to the Leaders table. So, I have a few questions: Do you want us to add the discriminator field in the supertype anyway? Should we expand our subtype hierarchy by adding additional subtypes (e.g., volunteer, paid, and/or non-leader) and decide whether it should be partial or complete disjoint? Should we simply document this decision in the design rationale and not include a discriminator field in the Student table? Frankly, the 0..1 subtype setup makes my skin crawl because a subtype discriminator in the supertype it would force us into a 3NF violation—something I wouldn’t allow in a production environment. I'm leaning toward not adding the discriminator field and just explaining our rationale in the design documentation. What do you think?

You need to submit a single merged PDF of both ERD and design rationale. (see additional doc for details) It is a reference to the paragraph at the end of the assignment document. Best, Koushik.

You should discuss the entities you created and their relationships, citing specific business rules (they are numbered to may this easy). This information is particularly useful for the bridge entities you create and any historical data tables.

    "content": "Hi Marc, I guess you downloaded the previous version of the zip file. We have updated the .zip file (just for problem 13). So you can take a look into it, the expected output will be 112.48. The difference is because of using JOIN / WHERE. When you are joining the entities the count of the users is coming as 8 (because they made 8 purchases). But when you are using where you will be getting 5. That is why there is a difference between both the outputs. I hope this helps. If you have any other questions please let me know. Best, Koushik.

Is there something I should do? Thanks, Marc ________________________________ From: MSCS Coursera <mscscoursera@clemson.edu> Sent: Thursday, November 14, 2024 7:16 AM Subject: Student Profile Hold Status for Spring 2025 Reg Hi all, I’m reaching out with an update regarding your student profile status and Spring registration. We were recently notified by CCIT that for students who are in both of the PBA courses will have a hold on their account that reads as “Non-degree to degree Hold”. The reason for this is that after grades are released, if you make a B or better in both courses, then an automatic process will be triggered in iRoar to update your student account from non-degree/PBA to Computer Science MS. If you are registered for Spring 2025 classes when this process is triggered, it will block the process from being completed. In order to avoid anyone’s account from getting stuck, we have placed a registration hold until after grades are released. If you do not see the hold, we may still be in the process of getting it added. Please do not register for Spring courses, as we will ask that you drop them. After grades are released, if you pass both courses with a B or better, then your account will be updated and this hold will be removed, and you can register for Spring courses. If for any reason you don't pass the PBA courses, the hold will still be removed, and we can always discuss possible paths forward! There are no course caps, so don’t worry about not securing a seat in the Spring courses. Once you register, bills will be automatically generated, and payments will be due Jan 2, 2025. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

Our demands on compute resources continue to scale, but the limitations of Ahmdal's law and Dennard scaling have proven increasingly difficult to overcome when approached solely through hardware or software design. Furthermore, even on the most advanced supercomputers, many HPC applications fail to utilize the collective system's performance. However, the resurgence of AI in industry has promoted an explosion of hardware and software codesign that have fueled massive improvements in GPU design and novel ASICs. These performance improvements are maximized on a broad variety of heterogeneous systems by specially tuning applications. Mimicking these developments across the whole of computing will require similarly holistic approaches combining specialty hardware, software that caters its design to the greatest strength of hardware, and fine-tuning on individual systems to truly maximize performance. In this work, we use three distinct perspectives to holistically address scalable system performance. We analyze the impacts of liquid immersion cooling technologies on sustained application performance and energy efficiency. Next, we present a case study where intentional algorithmic redesign for GPU acceleration permits robust performance improvements that endure through multiple generations of hardware. We find that memory latency forms a primary bottleneck for GPU-accelerated performance and demonstrate how algorithm-specific optimizations can greatly improve performance over multiple architecture generations. Finally, we tie these concepts together in the form of performance optimization techniques that respect both software- and hardware-based performance constraints. We improve the re-usability of performance insights with novel transfer learning techniques that make the cost of performance optimization more predictable and more successful in the short-term. Our insights demonstrate the necessity of systemic approaches for performance tuning in HPC.

All the pizzas have the Four Cheese Blend on it and are original crust. The order has the “Gameday Special” discount applied to it, and the ham and pineapple pizza has the “Specialty Pizza” discount applied to it. The pizzas were delivered to 115 Party Blvd, Anderson SC 29621. His phone number is the same as before. I have run this calculation manually and via our automation many (so many) times and the answer I keep getting is $5.5875 -> $5.59. As a sanity cross-check, it does not seem reasonable that the first pizza in that order should be quite a bit more expensive than the other two pizzas of the same size (even accounting for the “Specialty Pizza” discount). Don't worry, at this point I'm not waiting on your response 😉 (unless of course I've missed something really dumb here). Just pointing it out.",

Do schools?Are they required entities? I think the location field covers it. Do we need this?All you need is a class and class cost. Do assistant leaders have a cost? What if they're volunteers? Only the primary leader has the cost. Do sessions have a price? I.e., that non-leading students pay? If so, do assistant leaders have to pay? Not needed Do we need to document cardinality? (vs. connectivity) No, cardinality is not required to be documented, but implied from the ERD relationships. Are we okay expanding the student attributes? I.e., adding basic contact information? Sure. Extra attributes are fine. Do we need to describe levels in addition to naming them? I would describe them. The business rules mention \"schools\" and \"rooms\"—are schools important to location? Or should we just have \"LOCATION\" that has school and room identifiers? You can just specify the location as part of the class information but not needed as a separate entity. Do we need to track student class attendance history? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Do we need to track history of sessions/leaders? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Should we subclass 'LEADER' & use specialization hierarchy? Yes Is the assignment of leaders at a class level or session level? This is a design decision - document what you decide in the rational you are providing. Do we need to use the dependency diagram notations, EERM? The dependency diagram is unnecessary; however, you should think about your ERD and ensure it is in 3NF. Do we connect relationships at an entity or attribute level for the Relationships are always between entities ? Not sure I understand your question. connectors14) What does an A grade look like? What do we need to do to make it happen. ERD that meets the requirements and we can use rationale to validate your decisions. There are different ways to implement this. Do we need to track students' date of joining? Enroll date? Yes Please let us know if any of the questions need to be clarified. Thanks, Marc",

    "content": "Hi all, I hope you all are doing well! I wanted to reach out to share the Grad 360 calendar of events for the remainder of October (attached). Grad 360 provides a broad range of events and topics since they serve all of Clemson’s graduate students, so some events may not seem relevant to you or your interests. However, many are interesting and helpful in supporting your graduate and professional careers. Some events are in person on Clemson’s campus, but a majority are held over Zoom! You only need to sign up for the event on the Grad 360 website. My apologies for not getting some of these events out to you sooner, but I will continue to send out opportunities for you to get involved at Clemson and within the School of Computing! As always, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out! You can contact me through the mscscoursera@clemson.edu email address.

    "content": "Hi Gary, I feel you should have the discriminator field, because it is the field that is distinguishing between the student and leader. Professor Taylor, correct me if I am wrong, I don't see any 3NF violation because. as the field is not having any transitive dependency with any other attribute in the table. Regarding expanding the hierarchy, If you want to you can increase it. But that is not mandatory to do so. From the image, make sure you use the correct distinguisher(disjoint/overlapping).

The guideline suggests we include a discriminator in the supertype, but we currently have a partial disjoint subtype (0..1) with supertype Student and subtype Leader. Adding a discriminator field \"is_a_leader\" to Student would break 3NF because that field would depend on the existence of a related record in the Leader table rather than solely on the student_id. In our design, if we want to designate a student as a leader, we insert a record into the Leader table and rely on the existence of that record (via the shared PK, FK). This avoids an extra CRUD operation and redundant data. If a student becomes a leader, I would have to do 2 operations: an update to Student.student_is_a_leader and an insert to the Leaders table. So, I have a few questions: Do you want us to add the discriminator field in the supertype anyway? Should we expand our subtype hierarchy by adding additional subtypes (e.g., volunteer, paid, and/or non-leader) and decide whether it should be partial or complete disjoint? Should we simply document this decision in the design rationale and not include a discriminator field in the Student table? Frankly, the 0..1 subtype setup makes my skin crawl because a subtype discriminator in the supertype it would force us into a 3NF violation—something I wouldn’t allow in a production environment. I'm leaning toward not adding the discriminator field and just explaining our rationale in the design documentation. What do you think?

    "subject": "Final Official Transcripts + Registration Update",
    "content": "Hi all, I have an update regarding the submission of Final Official Transcripts that may impact your registration next week. For Final Official Transcripts, you must submit these to Clemson’s Graduate School within your first semester of enrollment. If you do not, then there is a hold placed on your account that will prevent you from registering. You can check your account for this transcript hold (as well as other holds) by logging into iRoar > Student Self-Service > under Student Records header > Advising Student Profile. From here, you will see a notification for holds in the top, right corner. Any holds that will prevent registration should provide specific instructions on how to remove the hold, but if you have any questions or concerns about the holds, please let me know! If your undergraduate university is in the US and offers virtual transcripts, then it should only take a few days to receive the transcript and update your profile. However, if you must mail in your transcript, then this process may take a bit longer. The very good news is that there is no cap on our Coursera classes, so you are still guaranteed a seat, as long as we receive your transcript before the last day to add a class! If you haven’t already, I would recommend that you submit your transcript as soon as possible to avoid any delays. I do want to apologize as normally notifications go out to students throughout the semester with reminders about their final transcripts, but unfortunately, due to a technical error, these notifications were not going out. Additionally, I believe some of the language in the orientation module may have been misleading, and we are having that updated! Again, I sincerely apologize for any confusion or inconvenience. However, we can hopefully get everyone sorted before the start of the Spring semester! I’ve attached our Final Official Transcript procedures for your reference. Thank you all so much for your patience! With this being a new program, we might run into a few technical issues along the way, but we are so excited to have you all on board! We hope that you are enjoying the curriculum and are excited to continue in the program!

On my question 2, I don't think I did a very good job explaining my confusion (or else I didn't fully understand your response), so let me try again… The attached image \"Module_7_Tree.jpg\" is a screenshot of my Coursera view of (some of!) the Module 7/9 content. As you can see, I have already completed \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\", which is listed under \"Module 7 Practice Exercises\" and circled in red in the attached screenshot. I was just setting up to work on \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\", which is listed under \"Module 7 SQL Lab Practice Sets\" and circled in green in the attached screenshot. When I compare the contents of the downloaded material for \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\" (again, circled in green) with the contents of the downloaded material for \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (circled in red), the look the same. More specifically, the second attachment, \"diff.jpg\", shows the diff comparison between my already submitted solutions for \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (red) and the unaltered contents from \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\". As you can see in the screenshot of the diff output, the problems that I have already submitted solutions for are the same as the problems in \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\" (the SQL is different because I have already corrected and tested the SQL included with \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\"). Does that make more sense now?

The 1st option is correct, even though it is not a good practice to modify the CamelCase to UpperCase, the query still works. 2. Regarding this, you need to submit the graded app item and you need to modify the script and make it executable. Like there are some syntax errors given in the script, you need to update them and make sure it runs in your local. Than you can submit it.

Option 3 is flat wrong, and while I have been toldthat some RDMSs will accept the final clause in Option 2 (`AND SPECIES IS 'Cat';`), I'm pretty sure that won't work in MySQL. What am I missing? Speaking of things that I seem to be missing, when I compared the downloadable contents of \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (\"ungraded app item\") and \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (\"graded app item\") , they appear to be identical—should I just submit my ungraded submissions to be graded? Or? Thanks very much! Marc Leavitt",

    "content": "Colloquium Notice Thomas Randall PhD Candidate, Computer Science Dissertation Defense Presentation Friday, April 11, 2025 at 12:30PM McAdams 106 Remote connection via https://clemson.zoom.us/j/99163737541 Title A Systemic Approach to Maximize Heterogeneous System Performance Abstract Continuous increases in high performance computing (HPC) throughput have served as catalysts for industry and scientific advancement in countless manners that have fundamentally shaped our modern world. Our demands on compute resources continue to scale, but the limitations of Ahmdal's law and Dennard scaling have proven increasingly difficult to overcome when approached solely through hardware or software design. Furthermore, even on the most advanced supercomputers, many HPC applications fail to utilize the collective system's performance. However, the resurgence of AI in industry has promoted an explosion of hardware and software codesign that have fueled massive improvements in GPU design and novel ASICs. These performance improvements are maximized on a broad variety of heterogeneous systems by specially tuning applications. Mimicking these developments across the whole of computing will require similarly holistic approaches combining specialty hardware, software that caters its design to the greatest strength of hardware, and fine-tuning on individual systems to truly maximize performance. In this work, we use three distinct perspectives to holistically address scalable system performance. We analyze the impacts of liquid immersion cooling technologies on sustained application performance and energy efficiency. Next, we present a case study where intentional algorithmic redesign for GPU acceleration permits robust performance improvements that endure through multiple generations of hardware. We find that memory latency forms a primary bottleneck for GPU-accelerated performance and demonstrate how algorithm-specific optimizations can greatly improve performance over multiple architecture generations. Finally, we tie these concepts together in the form of performance optimization techniques that respect both software- and hardware-based performance constraints. We improve the re-usability of performance insights with novel transfer learning techniques that make the cost of performance optimization more predictable and more successful in the short-term. Our insights demonstrate the necessity of systemic approaches for performance tuning in HPC.

More generally, will the autograder execute our triggers, SPs, and functions? Or is that more of a manual grading step? Just trying to think about autograder compliations… Should we be implementing CASCADEs on e.g., deletion of a pizza or an order? Or is this a bad idea? Thanks, Marc",

I.e., it should clearly populate the non-transactional tables (baseprice, customer, topping, discount), but should it also populate the transactional tables (ordertable, pickup, delivery, dinein, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping)? I'm asking because, at this point, our automation + a 'add all the orders' script generates a complete post order entry database & I can just use `mysqldump --no-create-info --skip-triggers --skip-routines` to get a script that will regenerate that complete database. I just don't want to submit that if what you really want is to just populate the non-transactional tables.

I think that there may be a problem with the cost of the first pizza in order #4 (highlighted below): #4. On April 20th at 7:11 pm there was a delivery order made by Andrew Wilkes-Krier for 1 xlarge pepperoni and Sausage pizza (Price: $27.94, Cost: $9.19), one xlarge pizza with Ham (extra) and Pineapple (extra) pizza (Price: $31.50, Cost: $6.25), and one xlarge Chicken and Bacon pizza (Price: $26.75, Cost: $5.55). All the pizzas have the Four Cheese Blend on it and are original crust. The order has the “Gameday Special” discount applied to it, and the ham and pineapple pizza has the “Specialty Pizza” discount applied to it. The pizzas were delivered to 115 Party Blvd, Anderson SC 29621. His phone number is the same as before. I have run this calculation manually and via our automation many (so many) times and the answer I keep getting is $5.5875 -> $5.59. As a sanity cross-check, it does not seem reasonable that the first pizza in that order should be quite a bit more expensive than the other two pizzas of the same size (even accounting for the “Specialty Pizza” discount). Don't worry, at this point I'm not waiting on your response 😉 (unless of course I've missed something really dumb here). Just pointing it out.",

    "content": "Dear SoC Graduate Students, Registration for Summer 2025 and Fall 2025 will begin Monday, April 7 at 8:00am. Time Tickets will be assigned Monday, March 31. Please review the information below and attached. Time Tickets: Once time tickets are assigned, please consult iROAR for your registration time ticket (iROAR > Student Self-Service > Advising Student Profile > Registration Notices (top right corner)), mark your calendars, and register as soon as your registration window opens. If you do not have a time ticket please email cpscreg@clemson.edu. You can also use the Plan Ahead tool to plan your schedule ahead of time. If a desired course is full: Add yourself to the waitlist if one is available (see attached instructions). If a seat becomes available, the first person on the waitlist will receive an email and have 24 hours to register for the class or remove themselves from the waitlist. If no action is taken within 24 hours they’re dropped from the waitlist and the system contacts the next person on the list. Be sure to check your emails daily. If no waitlist is available, please submit a Request Closed Course form (see attached instructions). A request does NOT guarantee a seat. We will be reviewing them later in Spring. You will receive an email if we are able to add you to the course. DO NOT EMAIL THE CLASS INSTRUCTOR. Do not submit a CCR prior to your time ticket opening or it will NOT be considered. Keep checking iROAR as other students are continually adding/dropping classes and seats may open. Search for and register for an alternative course (especially if an elective). This is especially important for international graduate students on an F1 visa and any graduate student on assistantship. Both require a minimum of 9 credit hours per semester. If you’re able to get into your preferred course, you can drop the alternative course prior to the drop deadline without negative consequence. For an academic calendar listing the add/drop deadline, see https://www.clemson.edu/registrar/academic-calendars/. Duplicate or Repeat Course Errors: Please email cpscreg@clemson.edu with your full name, CID, and course subject, number, and section (CPSC 9910-001) and error message. Changing Variable Credits See Attached instructions Courses outside the School of Computing (Computer Science MS only): As a reminder, Computer Science MS students are allowed to take up to four pre-approved courses outside the School of Computing to apply toward their master's degree. These courses will count toward their overall credit-hour requirements and their 6000/8000-level credit-hour minimum/maximums, but they do not count toward their concentration and breadth requirements. A list of pre-approved courses for the Compute Science MS is attached to this email. If you are a Computer Science MS student and find a course outside the School of Computing that you are interested in that is not on this list, please email Chip Lang (hclang@clemson.edu). Important registration deadlines (add, drop, withdraw, etc.) can be found on the Academic Calendar at https://www.clemson.edu/registrar/academic-resources/academic-calendars.html. It is your responsibility to follow these deadlines to avoid additional fees (See https://www.clemson.edu/sfs/adjustments-refunds/adjustment-policy.html).

Like there are some syntax errors given in the script, you need to update them and make sure it runs in your local. Than you can submit it.

Option 3 is flat wrong, and while I have been toldthat some RDMSs will accept the final clause in Option 2 (`AND SPECIES IS 'Cat';`), I'm pretty sure that won't work in MySQL. What am I missing? Speaking of things that I seem to be missing, when I compared the downloadable contents of \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (\"ungraded app item\") and \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (\"graded app item\") , they appear to be identical—should I just submit my ungraded submissions to be graded?

    "subject": "Student Profile Hold Status for Spring 2025 Reg",
    "content": "Hi all, I’m reaching out with an update regarding your student profile status and Spring registration. We were recently notified by CCIT that for students who are in both of the PBA courses will have a hold on their account that reads as “Non-degree to degree Hold”. The reason for this is that after grades are released, if you make a B or better in both courses, then an automatic process will be triggered in iRoar to update your student account from non-degree/PBA to Computer Science MS. If you are registered for Spring 2025 classes when this process is triggered, it will block the process from being completed. In order to avoid anyone’s account from getting stuck, we have placed a registration hold until after grades are released. If you do not see the hold, we may still be in the process of getting it added. Please do not register for Spring courses, as we will ask that you drop them. After grades are released, if you pass both courses with a B or better, then your account will be updated and this hold will be removed, and you can register for Spring courses. If for any reason you don't pass the PBA courses, the hold will still be removed, and we can always discuss possible paths forward! There are no course caps, so don’t worry about not securing a seat in the Spring courses. Once you register, bills will be automatically generated, and payments will be due Jan 2, 2025. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out! Kind regards, Becca Spilka Graduate Services Coordinator School of Computing College of Engineering, Computing, and Applied Sciences",

Adding/dropping classes: The last day to add a class is Tuesday, January 14th. We will not be able to add you to a class after this date, so please solidify your schedule before this date. The last day to drop a class is Wednesday, January 22nd. If you drop a class after this date, the course will show on your transcript with a W. The last day to drop a class without a final grade is Friday, March 14th. Keep in mind that these dates vary for courses that are not the full Spring term. All dates can be found on the Academic Calendar, here: https://www.clemson.edu/registrar/academic-calendars/index.html. For students who are part-time (less than 9 credit hours), keep in mind the dates for adjustments to Academic Fees when you drop a class. The last day to drop a class without a charge to your bill is Wednesday, January 14th. These dates also vary for courses that are not on the full Spring term, so I recommend reviewing this page: https://www.clemson.edu/sfs/adjustments-refunds/adjustment-calculations/index.html. If you have any questions about your bill, you can reach out to Student Financial Services at studentbillquestions@clemson.edu. For Spring 2025 graduates, you can go ahead and apply to graduate in iRoar under Student Self-Service. You must have an approved GS2 Plan of Study on file to apply to graduate, so if you have not already completed that, you should do so immediately. The deadline to apply to graduate is Wednesday, January 29th. After this date, you will incur a fee for each day the application is late. If you have any other questions, let me know!

    "subject": "Re: Questions on the Design Rationale requirement for Project Part 1 submission",
    "content": "Hi team, We have another question regarding our subtype specialization hierarchy notation in the ERD. The guideline suggests we include a discriminator in the supertype, but we currently have a partial disjoint subtype (0..1) with supertype Student and subtype Leader. Adding a discriminator field \"is_a_leader\" to Student would break 3NF because that field would depend on the existence of a related record in the Leader table rather than solely on the student_id. In our design, if we want to designate a student as a leader, we insert a record into the Leader table and rely on the existence of that record (via the shared PK, FK). This avoids an extra CRUD operation and redundant data. If a student becomes a leader, I would have to do 2 operations: an update to Student.student_is_a_leader and an insert to the Leaders table. So, I have a few questions: Do you want us to add the discriminator field in the supertype anyway? Should we expand our subtype hierarchy by adding additional subtypes (e.g., volunteer, paid, and/or non-leader) and decide whether it should be partial or complete disjoint? Should we simply document this decision in the design rationale and not include a discriminator field in the Student table? Frankly, the 0..1 subtype setup makes my skin crawl because a subtype discriminator in the supertype it would force us into a 3NF violation—something I wouldn’t allow in a production environment. I'm leaning toward not adding the discriminator field and just explaining our rationale in the design documentation. What do you think?

You need to submit a single merged PDF of both ERD and design rationale. (see additional doc for details) It is a reference to the paragraph at the end of the assignment document. Best, Koushik.

Danny Coursera Support Team | Degrees + Certificates --------------- Original Message --------------- From: Marc Leavitt [leavitt@clemson.edu<mailto:leavitt@clemson.edu>] Sent: 12/19/2024, 11:38 AM To: mscscoursera@clemson.edu<mailto:mscscoursera@clemson.edu> Subject: Re: Student Profile Hold Status for Spring 2025 Reg Becca, My grades are posted on iRoar, but there is still a hold on my registration for spring semester. Is there something I should do? Thanks, Marc ________________________________ From: MSCS Coursera <mscscoursera@clemson.edu<mailto:mscscoursera@clemson.edu>> Sent: Thursday, November 14, 2024 7:16 AM Subject: Student Profile Hold Status for Spring 2025 Reg Hi all, I’m reaching out with an update regarding your student profile status and Spring registration. We were recently notified by CCIT that for students who are in both of the PBA courses will have a hold on their account that reads as “Non-degree to degree Hold”. The reason for this is that after grades are released, if you make a B or better in both courses, then an automatic process will be triggered in iRoar to update your student account from non-degree/PBA to Computer Science MS. If you are registered for Spring 2025 classes when this process is triggered, it will block the process from being completed. In order to avoid anyone’s account from getting stuck, we have placed a registration hold until after grades are released. If you do not see the hold, we may still be in the process of getting it added. Please do not register for Spring courses, as we will ask that you drop them. After grades are released, if you pass both courses with a B or better, then your account will be updated and this hold will be removed, and you can register for Spring courses. If for any reason you don't pass the PBA courses, the hold will still be removed, and we can always discuss possible paths forward! There are no course caps, so don’t worry about not securing a seat in the Spring courses. Once you register, bills will be automatically generated, and payments will be due Jan 2, 2025. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

Do schools? Are they required entities? I think the location field covers it. Do we need this? All you need is a class and class cost. Do assistant leaders have a cost? What if they're volunteers? Only the primary leader has the cost. Do sessions have a price? I.e., that non-leading students pay? If so, do assistant leaders have to pay? Not needed Do we need to document cardinality? (vs. connectivity) No, cardinality is not required to be documented, but implied from the ERD relationships. Are we okay expanding the student attributes? I.e., adding basic contact information? Sure. Extra attributes are fine. Do we need to describe levels in addition to naming them? I would describe them. The business rules mention \"schools\" and \"rooms\"—are schools important to location? Or should we just have \"LOCATION\" that has school and room identifiers? You can just specify the location as part of the class information but not needed as a separate entity. Do we need to track student class attendance history? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Do we need to track history of sessions/leaders? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Should we subclass 'LEADER' & use specialization hierarchy? Yes Is the assignment of leaders at a class level or session level? This is a design decision - document what you decide in the rational you are providing. Do we need to use the dependency diagram notations, EERM? The dependency diagram is unnecessary; however, you should think about your ERD and ensure it is in 3NF. Do we connect relationships at an entity or attribute level for the Relationships are always between entities ? Not sure I understand your question. connectors 14) What does an A grade look like? What do we need to do to make it happen. ERD that meets the requirements and we can use rationale to validate your decisions. There are different ways to implement this. Do we need to track students' date of joining? Enroll date? Yes Please let us know if any of the questions need to be clarified. Thanks, Marc",

I.e., in the examples that I've seen (and remembered) from lecture and/or the textbook, attribute names were either snake/upper case or camel/lowercase AND the attribute name has reflected the entity in which it was defined (e.g., 'CUS_BALANCE' or 'CusBalance'. If we use attribute names that are snake/lowercase (e.g., \"cus_balance\"), is that a problem? If our attribute names do not reflect the table names (e.g., just \"balance\"), is that a problem?

We will not be able to add you to a class after this date, so please solidify your schedule before this date. The last day to drop a class is Wednesday, January 22nd. If you drop a class after this date, the course will show on your transcript with a W. The last day to drop a class without a final grade is Friday, March 14th. Keep in mind that these dates vary for courses that are not the full Spring term. All dates can be found on the Academic Calendar, here: https://www.clemson.edu/registrar/academic-calendars/index.html. For students who are part-time (less than 9 credit hours), keep in mind the dates for adjustments to Academic Fees when you drop a class. The last day to drop a class without a charge to your bill is Wednesday, January 22nd. These dates also vary for courses that are not on the full Spring term, so I recommend reviewing this page: https://www.clemson.edu/finance/student-financials/adjustments/. If you have any questions about your bill, you can reach out to Student Financial Services at studentbillquestions@clemson.edu. For Spring 2025 graduates, you can go ahead and apply to graduate in iRoar under Student Self-Service. You must have an approved GS2 Plan of Study on file to apply to graduate, so if you have not already completed that, you should do so immediately. The deadline to apply to graduate is Wednesday, January 29th. After this date, you will incur a fee for each day the application is late. If you have any other questions, let me know!

On my question 2, I don't think I did a very good job explaining my confusion (or else I didn't fully understand your response), so let me try again… The attached image \"Module_7_Tree.jpg\" is a screenshot of my Coursera view of (some of!) the Module 7/9 content. As you can see, I have already completed \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\", which is listed under \"Module 7 Practice Exercises\" and circled in red in the attached screenshot. I was just setting up to work on \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\", which is listed under \"Module 7 SQL Lab Practice Sets\" and circled in green in the attached screenshot. When I compare the contents of the downloaded material for \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\" (again, circled in green) with the contents of the downloaded material for \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (circled in red), the look the same. More specifically, the second attachment, \"diff.jpg\", shows the diff comparison between my already submitted solutions for \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (red) and the unaltered contents from \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\". As you can see in the screenshot of the diff output, the problems that I have already submitted solutions for are the same as the problems in \"Module 07 SQL Lab - PracticeSet01\" (the SQL is different because I have already corrected and tested the SQL included with \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\").

The 1st option is correct, even though it is not a good practice to modify the CamelCase to UpperCase, the query still works. 2. Regarding this, you need to submit the graded app item and you need to modify the script and make it executable. Like there are some syntax errors given in the script, you need to update them and make sure it runs in your local. Than you can submit it.

Option 3 is flat wrong, and while I have been toldthat some RDMSs will accept the final clause in Option 2 (`AND SPECIES IS 'Cat';`), I'm pretty sure that won't work in MySQL. What am I missing? Speaking of things that I seem to be missing, when I compared the downloadable contents of \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (\"ungraded app item\") and \"Module 07 SQL Lab PE-1\" (\"graded app item\") , they appear to be identical—should I just submit my ungraded submissions to be graded?

I simply went with creating tables without any FKs first, rather than following the 1:M relationships around the ERD, which is a pattern that you have to break when you get to 'Treatment_Apt' anyway. I don't know if it's intentional or not but I'm pretty sure the key designations for 'Treatment_Apt' are incorrect—I think TREATMENT_ID & APPOINTMENT_ID are both attributes of a composite PK and also that they are both independently FKs In Treatment, TREATMENT_ID is both misspelled ('TREAMENT_ID', i.e., missing the second 'T'), and mislabeled as an FK The third answer option is missing a comma between 'Pet' and 'Appointments' Thank you",

    "subject": "Clemson Board of Trustees first 2025 quarterly meeting focuses on University’s impact",
    "content": "FEBRUARY 7, 2025 Board of Trustees first 2025 quarterly meeting focuses on University’s impact With an overarching focus on the third pillar of Clemson Elevate — the impact of Clemson University to transform lives across the state of South Carolina and beyond — the 2025 Winter Quarterly Meeting of the Clemson Board of Trustees was held February 4-7. During committee meetings over two days and a full board meeting on Friday, February 7, the Board received updates from Clemson President James P. Clements and senior University leadership about ongoing research, education, student support, fundraising and statewide outreach. STUDENTS Doug Hallenbeck, vice president of student affairs, provided the Board with an update on the Division of Student Affairs’ efforts to enhance the student experience, preparing students for lives of leadership, service and significance. Hallenbeck highlighted both the division’s work in support of the academic mission alongside a focus on mental and physical well-being and recreation. President Clements customarily highlights a student at each of his quarterly updates to the Board, and spotlighted the achievements of Adam Gatch, a biochemistry honors student from Charleston. Gatch was recently named a Churchill Scholar, one of only 16 students nationwide to receive the award, which covers one year of master’s study at the University of Cambridge. Gatch’s achievement makes Clemson the only university whose students have been awarded a Churchill Scholarship in each of the last three years. Gatch plans to pursue a Master of Philosophy in chemistry and work with Professor Tuomas Knowles at the Centre for Misfolding Diseases, a leading research center dedicated to understanding the abnormal behavior of proteins in the brain in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. RESEARCH Tanju Karanfil, senior vice president for research, scholarship and creative endeavors, highlighted the substantial growth of Clemson’s research enterprise: Total research and development expenditures topped $300 million for the first time at $334 million in 2024, more than double that of 2013. During the fiscal year, Clemson graduated 324 Ph.D. students, an increase of 73 percent since 2013. As 2025 began, Clemson had 2,048 active research projects with a total budget amount of more than $823 million – a nearly 70 percent increase in the number of active projects over the past decade, and the combined value of those projects has more than tripled. Dr. Karanfil also recognized faculty members Ronnie Chowdhury and Cheng Sun for earning rare presidential awards from the U.S. government. Dr. Karanfil also provided numerous examples of Clemson transforming lives through research. Senior Vice President for External Affairs Angie Leidinger provided an overview of the University’s state budget priorities for FY25-26, which includes funding for tuition mitigation, a NextGen Computing Complex, the Clemson Center for Human Genetics, as well as support for several Public Service Activities priorities. Leidinger provided updates on the President’s Industry Council, corporate engagement activity and innovation campus strategy. Current and former students joined Arthrex Vice President of Communications and President’s Industry Council member Dennis O’Keefe and Executive Director of the Sales Innovation Program (SIP) at Clemson and Professor of Marketing Ryan Mullins to highlight the impact of SIP, both on the student experience and industry partnerships. Arthrex, a global medical device company, offers scholarships through the Arthrex Sales Innovation Scholars program to Clemson students and collaborates regularly with University research faculty and administration to advance mutually beneficial goals and meet the state’s economic goals in meaningful ways. ACADEMICS Provost Bob Jones provided updates on undergraduate admissions and longer-term enrollment trends, distance education strategies to generate new revenues and broaden the University’s reach, and Clemson Elevate metrics including a new Extension activities index. Dean Leslie Hossfeld provided an update on the impressive work of the College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences and its direct work transforming lives through improving health outcomes, meeting workforce demands and supporting rural communities across South Carolina. Action items from the Educational Policy Committee included the creation of several programs and centers: New M.S. in Statistics and Data Science New Ph.D. in Statistics and Data Science New Center for Community Engagement Research New Center for Roofing Innovation and Leadership (CRIL) New Center for Safety, Health & Ergonomics Research for Performance Augmentation (SHERPA) New Trilith Institute Instructional Site Name change of the Center for Criminal Justice and Social Research to the Center for Public Safety Research FINANCE AND FACILITIES The Board received an update to the University’s long range framework plan revised to align with the strategic plan and pillars of Clemson Elevate. The administration also provided a mid-year financial update while revisiting first quarter financials and the steps the University has taken since October 2024. The Board of Trustees approved the following facility projects: New lease for space in Greenville on the CU-ICAR Campus for College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences to accommodate faculty/student offices, teaching labs, and research space in support of the new Bachelor of Science degree in Automotive Engineering as well as research and teaching spaces for the School of Computing and Industrial Engineering.

If they are enabled, so let me lay this out carefully. I have triggers on insert and update of pizza_topping, pizza_discount, and order_discount (and yes, the triggers use stored functions) that update pizza and order prices+costs (incl discounts) If the triggers are enabled while the autograder is populating any of those 3 tables (), there's a pretty good chance that the price and cost of the pizza and/or order is going to be set wrong In the autograder environment, I don't have control over when the triggers are enabled In my local environment, I address this by not enabling the triggers (and functions and SPs) until after the non-transactional tables (customer, discount, baseprice, topping) are populated. Then I run a local script (not submitted to not confuse the autograder) that use the stored automation and triggers to populate ordertable, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping. This works great in my local environment I thought this was in-line with our previous email, but we're concerned that the triggers get executed at the wrong time and cause the grader to fail tests Questions: Have I made the concern clear? Is it okay to have triggers changing order and pizza price & cost? IMPORTANT: My partner (Gary) is super-jammed tonight, but he has been handling the submissions for our team. Can I take over doing submissions for our team tonight? Thanks & sorry, I thought this was in-the-can several hours ago.

For now, yes. They shouldn’t need to modify the topping inventory. They are already deducted and given to you. You need to apply order discounts. Pizza discount is applied and given to you! 2. They will be executed and manually verified as well! 3. You can use them! Best, Koushik.

More generally, will the autograder execute our triggers, SPs, and functions? Or is that more of a manual grading step? Just trying to think about autograder compliations… Should we be implementing CASCADEs on e.g., deletion of a pizza or an order? Or is this a bad idea? Thanks, Marc",

I simply went with creating tables without any FKs first, rather than following the 1:M relationships around the ERD, which is a pattern that you have to break when you get to 'Treatment_Apt' anyway. I don't know if it's intentional or not but I'm pretty sure the key designations for 'Treatment_Apt' are incorrect—I think TREATMENT_ID & APPOINTMENT_ID are both attributes of a composite PK and also that they are both independently FKs In Treatment, TREATMENT_ID is both misspelled ('TREAMENT_ID', i.e., missing the second 'T'), and mislabeled as an FK The third answer option is missing a comma between 'Pet' and 'Appointments' Thank you",

CONNIE TAYLOR Associate Director and Professor of Practice School of Computing, Clemson University o 864-656-5878 connie2@clemson.edu From: Marc Leavitt <leavitt@clemson.edu> Date: Friday, March 7, 2025 at 6:23 PM To: Koushik Kumar Varma Nallaparaju <knallap@g.clemson.edu>, Connie Taylor <connie2@clemson.edu>, Gary Matthew Webb <gmwebb@clemson.edu> Subject: Questions on Project Part 1: Database Design Koushik, My project partner (Gary Webb) and I are drafting the ERD and have compiled the following list of questions, in no particular order: Do rooms have a cost? Do schools?Are they required entities? I think the location field covers it. Do we need this?All you need is a class and class cost. Do assistant leaders have a cost? What if they're volunteers? Only the primary leader has the cost. Do sessions have a price? I.e., that non-leading students pay? If so, do assistant leaders have to pay? Not needed Do we need to document cardinality? (vs. connectivity) No, cardinality is not required to be documented, but implied from the ERD relationships. Are we okay expanding the student attributes? I.e., adding basic contact information? Sure. Extra attributes are fine. Do we need to describe levels in addition to naming them? I would describe them. The business rules mention \"schools\" and \"rooms\"—are schools important to location? Or should we just have \"LOCATION\" that has school and room identifiers? You can just specify the location as part of the class information but not needed as a separate entity. Do we need to track student class attendance history? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Do we need to track history of sessions/leaders? You should have this information included in one of your entities. Should we subclass 'LEADER' & use specialization hierarchy? Yes Is the assignment of leaders at a class level or session level? This is a design decision - document what you decide in the rational you are providing. Do we need to use the dependency diagram notations, EERM? The dependency diagram is unnecessary; however, you should think about your ERD and ensure it is in 3NF. Do we connect relationships at an entity or attribute level for the Relationships are always between entities ? Not sure I understand your question. connectors14) What does an A grade look like? What do we need to do to make it happen. ERD that meets the requirements and we can use rationale to validate your decisions. There are different ways to implement this. Do we need to track students' date of joining? Enroll date? Yes Please let us know if any of the questions need to be clarified. Thanks, Marc",

Candidate, Computer Science Thesis Defense Presentation Wednesday, April 9, 2025 at 3:30 PM McAdams 110E Title Divergence-Free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics in a Stream Digital Twin Abstract Digital Twins (DT) are being used by the South Carolina (SC) water community to simulate how SC streams will flow at various water levels. Currently, a DT called Gilligan simulates these streams utilizing weakly-incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). This method does not strictly enforce incompressibility, which leads to unrealistic water flows and unwanted visual artifacts that require post-processing effects to hide. To address these problems and simulate more realistic water flows, the Gilligan stream logic is updated and a state-of-the-art SPH method that enforces incompressibility—Divergence-Free SPH (DFSPH)—is implemented within the Gilligan framework. DFSPH is able to make use of two pressure solvers, one to ensure the fluid stays at constant density and another to keep the velocity field divergence free. Simulations are tested using a model of Hunnicutt Creek on the campus of Clemson University, showcasing the DFSPH water flows as being more realistic, detailed, and not requiring the same visual alterations to hide artifacts compared to the weakly-incompressible SPH Committee Members: Dr. Jerry Tessendorf, School of Computing (committee chair); Dr. Daljit Dhillon, School of Computing; Dr Matias Volonte, School of Computing.",

I.e., it should clearly populate the non-transactional tables (baseprice, customer, topping, discount), but should it also populate the transactional tables (ordertable, pickup, delivery, dinein, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping)? I'm asking because, at this point, our automation + a 'add all the orders' script generates a complete post order entry database & I can just use `mysqldump --no-create-info --skip-triggers --skip-routines` to get a script that will regenerate that complete database. I just don't want to submit that if what you really want is to just populate the non-transactional tables. Let me know if that doesn't make sense 😉 Thanks, Marc From: Koushik Kumar Varma Nallaparaju <knallap@g.clemson.edu> Sent: Friday, April 4, 2025 1:36 PM To: Marc Leavitt <leavitt@clemson.edu> Cc: Connie Taylor <connie2@clemson.edu>; Gary Matthew Webb <gmwebb@clemson.edu> Subject: Re: Possible error in Part 2 order #4 info Yes with 9.19 all the values are correct.

I think that there may be a problem with the cost of the first pizza in order #4 (highlighted below): #4. On April 20th at 7:11 pm there was a delivery order made by Andrew Wilkes-Krier for 1 xlarge pepperoni and Sausage pizza (Price: $27.94, Cost: $9.19), one xlarge pizza with Ham (extra) and Pineapple (extra) pizza (Price: $31.50, Cost: $6.25), and one xlarge Chicken and Bacon pizza (Price: $26.75, Cost: $5.55). All the pizzas have the Four Cheese Blend on it and are original crust. The order has the “Gameday Special” discount applied to it, and the ham and pineapple pizza has the “Specialty Pizza” discount applied to it. The pizzas were delivered to 115 Party Blvd, Anderson SC 29621. His phone number is the same as before. I have run this calculation manually and via our automation many (so many) times and the answer I keep getting is $5.5875 -> $5.59. As a sanity cross-check, it does not seem reasonable that the first pizza in that order should be quite a bit more expensive than the other two pizzas of the same size (even accounting for the “Specialty Pizza” discount). Don't worry, at this point I'm not waiting on your response 😉 (unless of course I've missed something really dumb here). Just pointing it out.",

Is there something I should do? Thanks, Marc ________________________________ From: MSCS Coursera <mscscoursera@clemson.edu> Sent: Thursday, November 14, 2024 7:16 AM Subject: Student Profile Hold Status for Spring 2025 Reg Hi all, I’m reaching out with an update regarding your student profile status and Spring registration. We were recently notified by CCIT that for students who are in both of the PBA courses will have a hold on their account that reads as “Non-degree to degree Hold”. The reason for this is that after grades are released, if you make a B or better in both courses, then an automatic process will be triggered in iRoar to update your student account from non-degree/PBA to Computer Science MS. If you are registered for Spring 2025 classes when this process is triggered, it will block the process from being completed. In order to avoid anyone’s account from getting stuck, we have placed a registration hold until after grades are released. If you do not see the hold, we may still be in the process of getting it added. Please do not register for Spring courses, as we will ask that you drop them. After grades are released, if you pass both courses with a B or better, then your account will be updated and this hold will be removed, and you can register for Spring courses. If for any reason you don't pass the PBA courses, the hold will still be removed, and we can always discuss possible paths forward! There are no course caps, so don’t worry about not securing a seat in the Spring courses. Once you register, bills will be automatically generated, and payments will be due Jan 2, 2025. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

But they should match the output as expected by autograder On Fri, Apr 4, 2025 at 19:53 Marc Leavitt <leavitt@clemson.edu> wrote: Sorry Koushik, but I'm still confused on the triggers. If they are enabled, so let me lay this out carefully. I have triggers on insert and update of pizza_topping, pizza_discount, and order_discount (and yes, the triggers use stored functions) that update pizza and order prices+costs (incl discounts) If the triggers are enabled while the autograder is populating any of those 3 tables (), there's a pretty good chance that the price and cost of the pizza and/or order is going to be set wrong In the autograder environment, I don't have control over when the triggers are enabled In my local environment, I address this by not enabling the triggers (and functions and SPs) until after the non-transactional tables (customer, discount, baseprice, topping) are populated. Then I run a local script (not submitted to not confuse the autograder) that use the stored automation and triggers to populate ordertable, order_discount, pizza, pizza_discount, and pizza_topping. This works great in my local environment I thought this was in-line with our previous email, but we're concerned that the triggers get executed at the wrong time and cause the grader to fail tests Questions: Have I made the concern clear? Is it okay to have triggers changing order and pizza price & cost? IMPORTANT: My partner (Gary) is super-jammed tonight, but he has been handling the submissions for our team. Can I take over doing submissions for our team tonight? Thanks & sorry, I thought this was in-the-can several hours ago.

For now, yes. They shouldn’t need to modify the topping inventory. They are already deducted and given to you. You need to apply order discounts. Pizza discount is applied and given to you! 2. They will be executed and manually verified as well! 3. You can use them! Best, Koushik.

More generally, will the autograder execute our triggers, SPs, and functions? Or is that more of a manual grading step? Just trying to think about autograder compliations… Should we be implementing CASCADEs on e.g., deletion of a pizza or an order? Or is this a bad idea? Thanks, Marc",

This extension was in response to the possible delay in midterm grades due to Hurricane Helene. You can find the updated date reflected on the Academic calendar for Fall 2024 here. Hope you all have a good weekend! Regards, Becca Spilka Graduate Services Coordinator School of Computing College of Engineering, Computing, and Applied Sciences From: MSCS Coursera Sent: Tuesday, October 22, 2024 12:03 PM Subject: Important Upcoming Dates Hi all, I am emailing to remind you of some important upcoming dates. First, the last day to withdraw from classes without a final grade is Monday, Oct 28th. This window ends at 11:59pm ET, so if you feel you may need to withdraw from a class, you need to do so before that date/time in order to not receive a final grade. The course will still appear on your transcript; however, your grade would show a “W” and does not impact your GPA. After this date/time, you will receive a final grade for the course. Second, registration for the Spring 2025 semester begins on Wednesday, November 6th at 8am ET. We will be offering both of the PBA courses (CPSC 8400 and 8740) in the Spring, and we will also be adding CPSC 6300, CPSC 6620, and HCC 6600 to the courses available through Coursera. If you have any questions about withdrawing or registration, please let me know by sending an email to mscscoursera@clemson.edu.

The field of computer graphics provides a means of understanding such surfaces through material modeling which uses both analytical models and data acquired from light-surface interactions. There are many efforts within the past decade in measuring materials for graphics, but common limitations in these works include not accounting for spatially varying properties and reliance on neural networks and synthetic datasets. Feathers from modern birds present diverse appearances due to how light interacts with their unique hierarchical microstructures. Variations in those structures lead to a variety of appearances at the macroscale that inherently require a graphical model which varies spatially across the surface. In order to acquire data to help create such models, I developed software and methods to use a motorized, universal stage for sample orientation within a custom spherical illumination system, the Variable Illumination Sphere (VarIS). I also propose a pipeline for predicting, measuring, and rendering spatially varying appearances using VarIS or other systems such as goniophotometers. I take inspiration from Dupuy & Jakob's adaptive-parameterization technique in measuring Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs), extending their approach to support spatially varying measurements from VarIS. I additionally present methods for analyzing and preprocessing data using distribution metrics and clustering that can reduce necessary capture time and storage. I acquired spatially varying appearances of a collection of feather samples across all major systematic groups of living birds, performing an analysis and fitting of the material data to achieve a relatively lightweight representation of feather light-scattering behaviors. My work presents an approach to capture complex, spatially varying appearances more efficiently and provides data for efforts in other disciplines to further understand the appearance of feathers.
